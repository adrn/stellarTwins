\begin{abstract}
The \gaia\ \tgas\ \project{Catalog} contains more than 2 million parallax measurements.
Conversion of a noisy parallax measurement into a posterior belief over distances requires inference with a prior.
Usually this prior represents some kind of belief about the Milky Way.
However, there is multi-band photometry for the \tgas\ stars from imaging surveys;
this imaging is incredibly informative about stellar distances.
Here we use color information on \tgas\ stars from \tmass\ to build a noise-deconvolved empirical prior distribution of stars in color--magnitude space.
This data-driven model contains no knowledge of the physics of stellar interiors or photospheres, nor of the Milky Way, but rather derives its precision from its generative model of noisy parallax measurements and an assumption of stationarity.
We use the Extreme Deconvolution (\xd) algorithm, which is an Empirical Bayes approximation to a full hierarchical model of the true parallax and photometry of every star.
The algorithm is run not in absolute-magnitude space but in a transformed space where the measurement uncertainty is closer to Gaussian.
The \xd-optimized prior is used to perform parallax and distance inferences for every star, yielding a precise stellar distance estimate and uncertainty (and full posterior) for every star.
Our posterior parallax estimates are more precise than the Gaia catalog outputs by a factor of [XXX] for the median \tgas\ star; and more precise than previous examples of Bayesian distance estimates by a factor of [YYY].
The precision can be attributed to the statistics concept of shrinkage.
We independently validate our distances by looking at members of Milky Way star clusters; for example, M67 is not visible at all in the \tgas\ parallax estimates, but appears clearly in our posterior parallax estimates.
All our results, including a posterior parallax and distance sampling for [ZZZ] \tgas\ stars, are available in companion electronic tables.

\section{Introduction}

The \gaia\ Mission (DWH CITE) will deliver more than a billion stellar distances.
Only a small fraction (but large number) of these distance
measurements will be purely astrometric:
\gaia\ uses astrometric parallax to determine the distances of the closer
stars, and calibrate spectrophotometric models.
These spectrophotometric models, in turn, along with \gaia's on-board
low-resolution $B_p\,R_p$ spectrophotometry, are used to provide
distance estimates to more distant stars (DWH CITE).
The full stack required for these distance inferences is complex.
It involves modeling not just stars, but also the dust in the Milky Way,
and the response of the telescope itself (DWH CITE).

With projects like \project{The Cannon} (DWH CITE) and \project{Avast}
(DWH CITE), we are exploring the extent to which our predictive models of
stars could be purely data-driven or statistical.
That is, under what circumstances could the data themselves deliver
more precise or more accurate information than any theoretical or
physics-based model?
The answer to this question is extremely context-dependent: It depends
on what data are available, how much data are available, and what
questions are being answered.
In general, data-driven models contain fewer assumptions than
physics-driven models, but they are also usually less interpretable.
However, the \gaia\ use case is ideal for thinking about purely statistical
models of stars:
The nearby stars are measured at very high signal-to-noise and can be
used to anchor empirical models that can be applied to the more
distant stars.

Here we deliver a demonstration-of-concept project that shows that a
data-driven model of the \gaia\ data could in principle deliver very
precise distances, without any input of the physics of stellar
evolution, interiors, or photospheres...[DWH CONTENT]

For our data-driven model of the color--magnitude diagram (CMD), we use
an Empirical-Bayes approach known as Extreme Deconvolution (DWH CITE).
This method deconvolves heteroskedastic data to derive an estimate
of the noise-free or low-noise distribution that \emph{would have}
been observed with far better data.
This method has been used in astrophysics
previously to model the velocity distribution of stars in the Solar
Neighborhood (DWH CITE BOTH) and to perform quasar target selection
in Sloan Digital Sky Survey data (DWH CITE BOTH).
Its advantage over other deconvolution methods is that it takes as input,
and handles in a principled way, heteroskedastic data.
Its principle disadvantage for the present purposes is that it requires
or implies a strictly Gaussian noise model.
In the below, this requires us to transform the CMD to a space in which
the noise is approximately Gaussian.

The novel use of XD here is to treat its output---the deconvolved CMD---as
a prior for use in inference of individual-star distances.
These inferences, one per star, provide much more precise parallax, distance,
or absolute magnitude estimates than we get from each star's primary 
\tgas\ parallax measurement alone.
That is, we are using the XD model to de-noise the \gaia\ parallax
measurements.
Technically, since XD produces a maximum-marginalized-likelihood estimator
of the deconvolved distribution,
its use as a prior is only approximately valid; it constitutes using the
data twice.
(It wouldn't be using the data twice---that is, it would be valid from a
probabilistic perspective---if we performed a full hierarchical Bayesian
inference.)
However, since the data set is large, the XD approximation is not bad; it is
sometimes known as the ``empirical Bayes'' method, and is well studied (DWH REFS).

This project is fundamentally a demonstration of concept:
We are only using the ``small'' (relative to the expected final \gaia\ data set)
\tgas\ Catalog.
We are performing only an approximation to full Bayesian hierarchical inference.
We have to use photometry that is ground-based, rather than the full-precision,
space-based photometry that the \gaia\ Mission will deliver.
However, as we show below, we get very good results.
It is promising that we will be able to obtain similar or even better results
in later \gaia\ data releases, and eventually put distances on $>10^9$
\gaia\ stars using photometric distance methodologies but without any
commitment to---or even use of---physical models of stars.

\section{Assumptions and methods}

We build a prior for the distance measurement of Gaia stars using the Gaia measured parallaxes plus APASS photometry to build a color-magnitude-like diagram that serves as the prior for distance measurements of Gaia stars. Instead of making assumptions about the physical distributions of stars in the galaxy, or using stellar models for the modeled HR diagram of stars, we build a prior from the data themselves.


magSN = parallaxSN = 16 (excluding systematic parallax error in tgas)
train gaussian means, mus, Vs on progressively lower SN dataset

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:bayes}
P(\theta|\textbf{E}, \textbf{I}) = P(\theta ) \frac{P(\textbf{E} |\theta,\textbf{I})}{P(\textbf{E})},
\end{equation}


where $\theta$ is the model parameters that generate the evidence $\textbf{E}$, and P($\theta$) is the prior knowledge of the model, and $P(\textbf{E} |\theta,\textbf{I})$ is the likelihood of the evidence, given the model and some other prior assumptions. Our evidence is the parallaxes and G band magnitudes from Gaia, and the B and V band magnitudes from APASS. We build the prior from this evidence using extreme deconvolution


Crossvalidation

\section{Data and results}

We use stars cross matched in the TGAS and APASS set of observations. We require there are no NaNs in any APASS photometric band, as well as every band having positive errors. We check that the match between APASS and TGAS is good using extreme APASS-WISE colors. We correct for dust using 3D Bayestar (Schlafly+Finkbeiner) with an estimate of the distance from sampling of posterior Gaia distances from Adrain. There is minimal dust to the matched stars. To build our model here we use the Gaia G band magnitude, parallax and APASS B-V color.

\section{Discussion}
